# Standardized-Testing-Statistical-Summaries-and-Inference
Project 1
Overview

This project was done as a first project at the Data Science Immersive Program at GA. Prior to this project we had gone over some basic statistics, learned some Python programming concepts, and also learned how to navigate files, packages, and libraries using the command line.

In this project I look at SAT and ACT scores around the United States. The main focus will be on Standardized Testing, Statistical Summaries and Inference.
Goals

Describe your data with visualizations & statistical analysis in a Jupyter notebook.
A 5 minute non-technical presentation targeting the ACt board. 
About the Jupyter Notebook
Description of the data

Datasets

Two datasets in separet csv-files were used, containing:

ACT Scores


These data give average SAT and ACT scores by state, as well as participation rates, for the graduating class of 2017.
